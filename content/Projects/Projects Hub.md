This project revolved around my creation of a sandbox environment, "HomeLab" or server for the hosting of files and home media as well as running a number of personal services. Its primary usage is to run virtual machines, useful docker instances, and experiment with applications separately from daily driver systems, as well as creating a unified "coding hub", elaborated upon in the relevant [[HomeLab|writeup (soon to come)]].
<br>**Relevant Skills:** SSH SFTP, VIM, Shell Management, Hypervisor, Docker, VPN, Proxying, Networking, Linux, etc. <br>

During the COVID-19 lockdown our Long Beach Poly Rabbotics (Robotics) team elected to participate in a mini-bot competition with individuals in our team in groups of 3-4. Pictured above is the final iteration of my own teams minibot, but the [[Mini-Bot|writeup (soon to come)]] delves more deeply into the engineering design process, iteration, and final robot alike.
<br>**Relevant Skills:** Arduino, RasPi, C++, 3D Modeling, 3D Printing<br>

<h3>This Website</h3>

![[developingSite.png]]

**Years Active:** 2023-Present <br>
The core purpose of this site is intended to be a resume or cataloging website that collects as much relevant information about me as possible for presentation to colleagues, professionals and prospective employers alike. Granted, that was the starting point, but I plan to continue developing it to host my own blog, interaction via comment boards, and perhaps even notes in a private capacity as things progress. The [[This Website|writeup (soon to come)]] further details the tools, process, and goals of the site in greater depth. <br>
**Relevant Skills:** Web Development, CSS, JavaScript, HTML, Obsidian, Markdown, Unraid <br>
