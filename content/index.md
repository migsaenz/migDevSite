<h3>â†’ Hey, I'm Miguel</h3>

![[iFixitMe.jpg]]

Welcome to my site! I am a student and researcher focused on robotics, embedded and distributed systems, and low level programming. I've been a part of robotics for nearly a decade throughout my youth and through to now.

I'm currently an undergrad pursuing a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. I have also been lucky enough to pursue [[Research Hub|research]] at Cal Poly, both over Summer 2024 and continuing this Winter Quarter 2025. I am deeply involved with a number of organizations on campus, chief among them being our robotics(link to website) team, which I have [[Robotics Hub|contributed]] to steadily and significantly throughout the past several years. 

I also work on a number of [[Projects Hub|personal projects]], including the very website you are reading right now. The tools and journey used to build this site are pretty cool, so check out my own writeup, as well as the core tool for generation (link to Quartz) if you've got the time. You can get more info on me from my [[Personal Documents Hub|resume]], any of the socials listed below, or by contacting me directly (link to email). Thanks for dropping by!
